    "description": "From a personal standpoint, I find it enjoyable and rewarding to collaborate with coworkers and get feedback on the work Iâ€™ve done.  A career in coding is different than work in many other fields.  Even if the code works as expected, there are often additional ways to make it even better. I feel proud that the asset I bring to the companies I work for is more than just using my time to do tasks.  Instead, I have real responsibility and am able to add real value, building useful features and bringing concepts into reality."
